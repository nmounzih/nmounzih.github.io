        <p class='header'>About Me</p>
        <p>Hi, I'm Nadia. I'm interested in logic puzzles, going for runs, being outside, learning new technologies, and mimosa brunch. Not necessarily in that order.</p>
        <p>I developed a love for programming while teaching English in Thailand. I started learning Javascript on my free periods in between classes and then expanded that knowledge into back end web development. Living abroad fostered my ability to adapt to foreign environments and pick up new skills quickly.</p>
        <p>I am enthusiastic about learning and trying new things in order to grow my skills as a programmer. Feel free to contact me!</p>
